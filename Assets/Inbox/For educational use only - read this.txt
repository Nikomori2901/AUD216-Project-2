This project is for educational use, only on SAE computers.If you wish to use this on your own computer, make sure to purchase a copy of the level via the Synty Store.They regularly offer half price sales for their assets, which is good as additional levels can help to develop a more diverse game sound design portfolio. These levels offer a good mix between performance and aesthetics, whilst being expandable using other Synty packs.Good luck with your sound designs!
